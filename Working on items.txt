## 📅 **Key Observations by Day**

| **Day** | **Inventory (Wood, Apple, Corn, Tomato)** | **Seed Inventory (Corn, Tomato)** | **Money** | **Observations** |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|------------------|
| **1**   | Wood: 3, Apple: 19, Corn: 4, Tomato: 2   | Corn: 1, Tomato: 2                | 200       | Initial state with inventory set. |
| **2–4** | Wood: 3, Apple: 19, Corn: 4, Tomato: 2   | Corn: 1, Tomato: 2                | 200       | No changes detected. |
| **5–14**| Wood: 3, Apple: 19, Corn: 4, Tomato: 2   | Corn: 1, Tomato: 2                | 198       | Money dropped by 2 on Day 5 and remained static for 10 days. |
| **15–16**| Wood: 3, Apple: 19, Corn: 4, Tomato: 2  | Corn: 1, Tomato: 2                | 225       | Money increased by 27, inventory unchanged. |

## 🕵️‍♂️ **Detailed Observations**

### 1️⃣ **Static Inventory (Days 1–16)**  
- **Wood:** 3  
- **Apple:** 19  
- **Corn:** 4  
- **Tomato:** 2  

**Observation:**  
- Across 16 days, **no inventory changes occurred** despite multiple day resets.  
- This suggests **no new trees were cut, no crops were harvested, and no seeds were planted.**

**Possible Cause:**  
- The reset logic isn't triggering game-world updates (e.g., regenerating apples on trees or updating soil layers).  

---

### 2️⃣ **Static Seed Inventory (Days 1–16)**  
- **Corn:** 1  
- **Tomato:** 2  

**Observation:**  
- Seeds were **neither planted nor purchased.**  
- Suggests a **lack of interaction with planting mechanics** or a failure in the seed-usage logic.

**Possible Cause:**  
- The logic for consuming seeds when planting might not be functioning correctly.  
- The soil layer may not be updating or reflecting planting actions.

---

### 3️⃣ **Money Fluctuations**
- **Day 5:** Money drops from **200 → 198**.  
- **Day 6–14:** Money remains static at **198**.  
- **Day 15:** Money jumps to **225** (+27).  

**Observations:**  
- The drop of 2 on **Day 5** suggests an expense (e.g., seed purchase or daily cost).  
- The increase on **Day 15** suggests an income event (e.g., sale of goods or scripted increase).  
- However, these financial changes have **no correlation to inventory changes**, which suggests **non-player-triggered events** (e.g., scripted money updates).  

**Possible Cause:**  
- The money logic might be hardcoded or event-driven rather than being tied to game mechanics (e.g., selling apples or corn).  

---

## 🛠️ **Root Cause Hypotheses**

### 🐍 **1. Game State Not Resetting Properly on Day End**
- Inventory and seed values are **not updated across days**.
- `self.soil_layer.update_plants()` or tree regeneration (`Tree.create_fruit`) might not be functioning properly.

### 🐍 **2. Save Function Called Twice During Reset**
- Day increments may happen twice, but save states remain identical across days.

### 🐍 **3. Player Actions Not Reflected in Save**
- Actions like planting, harvesting, or cutting trees might not update the player inventory.

## ✅ **Recommendations for Debugging**

### 1️⃣ **Log State During Reset**

Add debug statements in **`level.py`** in the `reset` method to track each step.

```python
def reset(self):
    print("[DEBUG] Resetting day...")
    print(f"Before Reset: Inventory: {self.player.item_inventory}, Seeds: {self.player.seed_inventory}, Money: {self.player.money}")

    self.save_system.record_day(
        day=self.save_system.data["current_day"],
        inventory=self.player.item_inventory,
        seed_inventory=self.player.seed_inventory,
        money=self.player.money
    )

    print(f"[DEBUG] Day {self.save_system.data['current_day']} saved.")
```

### 2️⃣ **Check Day Incrementation**
- Verify if `self.save_system.data["current_day"]` increments **only once per reset**.

### 3️⃣ **Verify Soil and Tree Logic**
- Ensure these calls execute correctly during `reset()`:
   ```python
   self.soil_layer.update_plants()
   self.soil_layer.remove_water()
   for tree in self.tree_sprites.sprites():
       tree.create_fruit()
   ```

### 4️⃣ **Validate Player Actions Are Captured**
- Print the player's inventory after **harvesting crops**, **cutting trees**, or **buying seeds**:
   ```python
   print(f"[DEBUG] Player Inventory: {self.item_inventory}, Seeds: {self.seed_inventory}")
   ```

### 5️⃣ **Monitor Day Counter and Save Trigger**
- Add a debug log in `SaveSystem.record_day`:
   ```python
   print(f"[DEBUG] Saving Day {day} with Inventory: {inventory}, Money: {money}")
   ```

---

## 🎯 **Expected Outcome After Fix**
1. **Dynamic Inventory Changes:**  
   - Chopping trees increases wood.  
   - Harvesting crops adjusts crop inventory.  
   - Planting decreases seeds.  

2. **Correct Money Adjustments:**  
   - Money reflects player actions like buying seeds or selling crops.

3. **One Day Advancement Per Reset:**  
   - Each reset increments the day by **1**.

4. **Daily Unique Snapshots in Save Data:**  
   - Each day in the `daily_history` will show distinct states.

---

## 🐍 **Temporary Debugging Command**
For quick monitoring, add this in `reset`:
```python
print(f"[DEBUG] Day {self.save_system.data['current_day']} - Inventory: {self.player.item_inventory}, Seeds: {self.player.seed_inventory}, Money: {self.player.money}")
```
